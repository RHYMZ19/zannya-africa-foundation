                <p>
                    Zannya Africa Foundation (ZAF) is using sports because of its positive values to help the unprivileged children, youths and women in Uganda.

The foundation commenced its activities in 2018 but serious work started the following year according to Project Manager Samuel Mugalu.

Zannya, bearing an indigenous name for ‘Play,’ is a sport based Non Government Organization that has provided access to sports and recreational activities to kids not only to play and have fun but also to transform their lives for a better living.

“We have addressed issues like unemployment, early pregnancies, drug abuse, HIV, climate change, domestic violence among others,” said Mugalu.

The Project Manager revealed that they chose to use Sports because it has a number of benefits that include proper growth and development among children.

“Children who participate in Sports are less likely to involve in crime,” Mugalu adds. “Sports is not about winning but rather building stronger and healthier, happier and safer communities. That is what we are looking at majorly.”

Zannya Foundation has partnered with JB Caring Hearts and Leto Foundation and are targeting to bring more partners on board that include academies and clubs.
